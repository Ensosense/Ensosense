# 👋 Hi there, I'm Lilia!

I'm a **backend developer** with a passion for **cloud solutions** and **microservices architecture**. Currently exploring the world of **DevOps** and **AWS**. Always learning and always building! 🚀

### 🔧 Technologies I work with:
- Java ☕
- Spring Boot 🌱
- AWS (DynamoDB, ECS with Fargate, Cognito, ALB) ☁️
- CI/CD with GitHub Actions 🔄
- Docker 🐳

### 👨‍💻 What I'm working on:
I'm currently building an **e-commerce platform** to dive deeper into microservices and cloud-based solutions. 🌟 Every day I’m leveling up my skills and seeing just how many new things I can mess up before I get it right! 💪😄

### 📚 In my free time:
- Diving into personal coding projects 💻
- Exploring new tools and technologies 🛠️
- Getting lost in a good programming book 📖 (because who needs sleep, right?)
- Enjoying quality time with my family 🎉
